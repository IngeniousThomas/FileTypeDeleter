**Prerequisites**  

For macOS & Linux:  

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the folder where `FTD_suless.sh` or `FTD_su.sh` is located.  
2. Make the script executable (this only needs to be done once on macOS/Linux):  
   - For the command-line version (`FTD_suless.sh`):  
     chmod +x FTD_suless.sh  
   - For the GUI version (`FTD_su.sh`):  
     chmod +x FTD_su.sh  
3. Run the script using one of these methods:  
   - Recommended method:  
     - For `FTD_suless.sh`:  
       ./FTD_suless.sh  
     - For `FTD_su.sh`:  
       ./FTD_su.sh  
   - Alternative method (if execution permission is missing):  
     - For `FTD_suless.sh`:  
       bash FTD_suless.sh  
     - For `FTD_su.sh`:  
       bash FTD_su.sh  
   - You need to run these commands every time you want to launch the tool.

For Windows (Batch Version - `FTD_Windows.bat`):  

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the folder where `FTD_Windows.bat` is located.  
2. Run the script using one of these methods:  
   - Double-click `FTD_Windows.bat` to run it.  
   - OR open Command Prompt (CMD), navigate to the script folder, and run:  
     FTD_Windows.bat  

---

For Windows (PowerShell Version - `FTD_Windows.ps1`):  

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the folder where `FTD_Windows.ps1` is located.  
2. Run the script using one of these methods:  
   - Right-click `FTD_Windows.ps1` â†’ Select "Run with PowerShell".  
   - OR open PowerShell, navigate to the script folder, and run:  
     .\FTD_Windows.ps1  
3. If PowerShell blocks execution, enable scripts temporarily by running:  
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process  
   This is only needed if PowerShell prevents scripts from running.  

---

Summary:  

- macOS/Linux users must make the script executable using `chmod +x` before running it.  
- Windows users can run the batch script (`.bat`) directly or use the PowerShell script (`.ps1`).  
- PowerShell execution policy may need to be adjusted for `.ps1` scripts to run.  

Now you are ready to use File Type Deleter on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
