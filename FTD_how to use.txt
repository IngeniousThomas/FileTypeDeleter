# **Prerequisites**  

## **For macOS & Linux**
1. **Open Terminal** and navigate to the folder where `FTD_suless.sh` or `FTD_su.sh` is located.  
2. **Make the script executable** (only needed once on macOS/Linux):  
   - **For `FTD_suless.sh` (Command-line version):**  
     ```sh
     chmod +x FTD_suless.sh
     ```
   - **For `FTD_su.sh` (GUI version with `dialog`):**  
     ```sh
     chmod +x FTD_su.sh
     ```
3. **Run the script using one of these methods:**  
   - **Recommended method:**  
     - For `FTD_suless.sh`:  
       ```sh
       ./FTD_suless.sh
       ```
     - For `FTD_su.sh`:  
       ```sh
       ./FTD_su.sh
       ```
   - **Alternative method (if execution permission is missing):**  
     - For `FTD_suless.sh`:  
       ```sh
       bash FTD_suless.sh
       ```
     - For `FTD_su.sh`:  
       ```sh
       bash FTD_su.sh
       ```

   *(You need to run these commands every time you want to launch the tool.)*

## **For Windows**
### **Batch Version (`FTD_Windows.bat`)**
1. Open **File Explorer** and navigate to the folder where `FTD_Windows.bat` is located.  
2. **Run the script** using one of these methods:  
   - **Double-click** `FTD_Windows.bat`.  
   - **OR** open **Command Prompt (CMD)**, navigate to the script folder, and run:  
     ```cmd
     FTD_Windows.bat
     ```

---

### **PowerShell Version (`FTD_Windows.ps1`)**
1. Open **File Explorer** and navigate to the folder where `FTD_Windows.ps1` is located.  
2. **Run the script** using one of these methods:  
   - **Right-click** `FTD_Windows.ps1` â†’ Click **"Run with PowerShell"**.  
   - **OR** open **PowerShell**, navigate to the folder, and run:  
     ```powershell
     .\FTD_Windows.ps1
     ```
3. **If PowerShell blocks execution**, enable scripts temporarily by running:  
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
   ```  
   *(This is only needed if PowerShell prevents scripts from running.)*

---

## **Summary**
- **macOS/Linux users** must make the script executable using `chmod +x` before running it.  
- **Windows users** can run the batch script (`.bat`) directly or use the PowerShell script (`.ps1`).  
- **PowerShell execution policy may need to be adjusted** for `.ps1` scripts to run.  

Now you're ready to use **File Type Deleter** on **macOS, Linux, and Windows**! ðŸš€
